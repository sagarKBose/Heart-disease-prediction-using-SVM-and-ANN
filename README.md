# Heart-disease-prediction-using-SVM-and-ANN
I used SVM and ANN models for prediction
Dataset used : South Africa Heart Disease Dataset (sa-heart)
Dataset Link : https://www.openml.org/d/1498

About the Dataset :
A retrospective sample of males in a heart-disease high-risk region of the
Western Cape, South Africa. There are roughly two controls per case of
CHD. Many of the CHD positive men have undergone blood pressure
reduction treatment and other programs to reduce their risk factors after
their CHD event. In some cases, the measurements were made after these
treatments. These data are taken from a larger dataset, described in
Rousseauw et al, 1983, South African Medical Journal.
In the medical field heart disease prediction is one of the most complicated
tasks. Nowadays at least one person dies per minute due to heart disease.
Heart disease prediction is a complex task so a proper automated process
should be followed to avoid risks and alert the patient in advance.

Attributes used in the dataset :
sbp systolic blood pressure
tobacco cumulative tobacco (kg)
ldl low density lipoprotein cholesterol
adiposity
famhist family history of heart disease (Present,
Absent)
typea type-A behavior
obesity
alcohol current alcohol consumption
age age at onset
chd response, coronary heart disease

Data Pre-processing:
At first, all the data that the user will enter will be read. It will help to get an idea of what data we are working with. Then we need to set up the columns so that the variables we entered can display along with column names. We have to enter unique values for each variable. Now we have to summarize all the factors i.e. count, mean, standard deviation, min, and max for the numeric variables. Then we have to check for missing values for each column. In our case, we have no missing values in the data frame.
